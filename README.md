# HelldiversStrategemCaller
## General info
This is a personal project of a gamer and student who just likes to play helldivers. If you would like to download it and use it for yourself, feel free to do so. 
## Server (java)
The java server is packaged in an exe and you can use that to run it. I build the jar with the gradle build tool and things like JavaFX should be included in the compiled jar, if not so let me know! To package the jar in an exe I used Launch4j and I included the config file the server folder.
## Android app (kotlin)
The app is still a work in progress, but is nearly done. For now the basic functionality is there, I only need to implemented something so the arrow screen closes itself when you are done pressing the arrow keys. You can still install the app if you want by opening it in android studio and pluging in your phone, than running the code on you connected device. The app will stay installed and you can use it like normal. I will try to include an .apk in the future when I deem the app ready enough. When you try installing the app with android studio make sure your usb debugging is enabled in your developer settings of your phone. Here is a [simple guide](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options#:~:text=Enable%20USB%20debugging%20on%20your%20device,-Before%20you%20can&text=Enable%20USB%20debugging%20in%20the,Advanced%20%3E%20Developer%20Options%20%3E%20USB%20debugging) on how to enable it.
## Crashes
If you experience any crashes you can let me know by submitting it in the issues section here on github. I will try my best to fix them and if they stack up to much I might open the project for open source contribution.
## Support
If you want to support me in any way, just share this project with your friends or online and enjoy. It gives me joy when I see other people enjoying something I made or worked on!
